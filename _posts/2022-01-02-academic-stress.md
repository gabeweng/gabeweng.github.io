Academic stress is a common problem among students in the U.S. According to the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and the Yale Child Study Center, “75% of U.S. high school students expressed boredom, anger, sadness, fear, or stress”. And, this makes sense. High school is a very busy time for students, and there is a lot to worry about. Kids have to worry about homework, essays, assessments, grades, college applications, and standardized testing. According to a Student Life Survey Press Release from The Princeton Review, 25% of students attributed their stress to homework, 18% of them to grades, 17% to a desire to do well, 8% to other students, and 8% to getting into college.
