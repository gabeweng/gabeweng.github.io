According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, “7.0 million young people ages 12 to 20 reported that they drank alcohol beyond ‘just a few sips’ in the past month” in 2019. Alcohol causes more aggressive and less rational behavior, and in the long term can impair brain development and lead to alcohol abuse in adulthood. Alcohol is often a direct cause of deaths from motor vehicle crashes, homicides, alcohol overdoses, falls, burns, drowning, and suicides, and also increases the chances of one getting into accidents.

Underaged individuals often acquire alcohol through their parents or pay people to buy the substance for them. The consumption of alcohol by adolescents often can be attributed to peer pressure, desire for independence, and also stress.For further reference take a look at: https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/underage-drinking
