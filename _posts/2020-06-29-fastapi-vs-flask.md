While Flask has become the de-facto choice for API development in Machine Learning projects, there is a new framework called FastAPI that has been getting a lot of community traction.  

![Flask and FastAPI Logo](/images/flask-to-fastapi.png){: .align-center}  

I recently decided to give FastAPI a spin by porting a production Flask project. It was very easy to pick up FastAPI coming from Flask and I was able to get things up and running in just a few hours. 

The added benefit of automatic data validation, documentation generation and baked-in best-practices such as pydantic schemas and python typing makes this a strong choice for future projects.  

In this post, I will introduce FastAPI by contrasting the implementation of various common use-cases in both Flask and FastAPI.  

<div class="notice--info">
<strong>Version Info:</strong>
<p>
At the time of this writing, the Flask version is 1.1.2 and the FastAPI version is 0.58.1
</p>
</div>

## Installation  
Both Flask and FastAPI are available on PyPI. For conda, you need to use the `conda-forge` channel to install FastAPI while it's available in the default channel for Flask.  

**Flask:**
```shell
pip install flask
conda install flask
```

**FastAPI:**
```shell
pip install fastapi uvicorn
conda install fastapi uvicorn -c conda-forge
```

## Running "Hello World" 
**Flask:**
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Now you can run the development server using the below command. It runs on port 5000 by default.  
```shell
python app.py
```

**FastAPI**  
```python
# app.py
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/')
def home():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run(app)
```

FastAPI defers serving to a production-ready server called `uvicorn`. We can run it in development mode with a default port of 8000.   
```shell
python app.py
```

## Production server 
**Flask:**
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

For a production server, `gunicorn` is a common choice in Flask.  
```shell
gunicorn app:app
```

**FastAPI**  
```python
# app.py
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/')
def home():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run(app)
```

FastAPI defers serving to a production-ready server called [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/). We can start the server as:
```shell
uvicorn app:app
```

You can also start it in hot-reload mode by running
```shell
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Furthermore, you can change the port as well.
```shell
uvicorn app:app --port 5000
```

The number of workers can be controlled as well.
```shell
uvicorn app:app --workers 2
```

You can use `gunicorn` to manage uvicorn as well using the following command. All regular gunicorn flags such as number of workers(`-w`) work.  
```shell
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app:app
```


## HTTP Methods  
**Flask:**
```python
@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def example():
    ...
```

**FastAPI:**  
```python
@app.post('/')
def example():
    ...
```
You have individual decorator methods for each HTTP method.
```python
@app.get('/')
@app.put('/')
@app.patch('/')
@app.delete('/')
```

## URL Variables  
We want to get the user id from the URL e.g. `/users/1` and then return the user id to the user.  
 
**Flask:**  
```python
@app.route('/users/<int:user_id>')
def get_user_details(user_id):
    return {'user_id': user_id}
```

**FastAPI:**  

In FastAPI, we make use of type hints in Python to specify all the data types. For example, here we specify that `user_id` should be an integer. The variable in the URL path is also specified similar to f-strings.  

```python
@app.get('/users/{user_id}')
def get_user_details(user_id: int):
    return {'user_id': user_id}
```

## Query Strings    
We want to allow the user to specify a search term by using a query string `?q=abc` in the URL.  
 
**Flask:**  
```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/search')
def search():
    query = request.args.get('q')
    return {'query': query}
```

**FastAPI:**  
```python
@app.get('/search')
def search(q: str):
    return {'query': q}
```

## JSON POST Request  
Let's take a toy example where we want to send a JSON POST request with a `text` key and get back a lowercased version.  
```json
# Request
{"text": "HELLO"}

# Response
{"text": "hello"}
```

 
**Flask:**  
```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/lowercase', methods=['POST'])
def lower_case():
    text = request.json.get('text')
    return {'text': text.lower()}
```

**FastAPI:**  
If you simply replicate the functionality from Flask, you can do it as follows in FastAPI.  
```python
from typing import Dict

@app.post('/lowercase')
def lower_case(json_data: Dict):
    text = json_data.get('text')
    return {'text': text.lower()}
```

But, this is where FastAPI introduces a new concept of creating Pydantic schema that maps to the JSON data being received. We can refactor the above example using pydantic as:   
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Sentence(BaseModel):
    text: str

@app.post('/lowercase')
def lower_case(sentence: Sentence):
    return {'text': sentence.text.lower()}
```

As seen, instead of getting a dictionary, the JSON data is converted into an object of the schema `Sentence`. As such, we can access the data using data attributes such as `sentence.text`. This also provides automatic validation of data types. If the user tries to send any data other than a string, they will be given an auto-generated validation error.  
  
**Example Invalid Request**
```json
{"text": null}
```

**Automatic Response**
```json
{
    "detail": [
        {
            "loc": [
                "body",
                "text"
            ],
            "msg": "none is not an allowed value",
            "type": "type_error.none.not_allowed"
        }
    ]
}
```

## File Upload  
Let's create an API to return the uploaded file name. The key used when uploading the file will be `file`.    

**Flask**  
Flask allows accessing the uploaded file via the request object.
```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files.get('file')
    return {'name': file.filename}
```

**FastAPI:**  
FastAPI uses function parameter to specify the file key.  

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File

app = FastAPI()

@app.post('/upload')
def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    return {'name': file.filename}
```

## Form Submission   
We want to access a text form field that's defined as shown below and echo the value.  
```html
<input name='city' type='text'>
```

**Flask**  
Flask allows accessing the form fields via the request object.
```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def echo():
    city = request.form.get('city')
    return {'city': city}
```

**FastAPI:**  
We use function parameter to define the key and data type for the form field.  

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
app = FastAPI()

@app.post('/submit')
def echo(city: str = Form(...)):
    return {'city': city}
```

We can also make the form field optional as shown below
```python
from typing import Optional

@app.post('/submit')
def echo(city: Optional[str] = Form(None)):
    return {'city': city}
```

Similarly, we can set a default value for the form field as shown below.  
```python
@app.post('/submit')
def echo(city: Optional[str] = Form('Paris')):
    return {'city': city}
```


## Cookies  
We want to access a cookie called `name` from the request.  

**Flask**  
Flask allows accessing the cookies via the request object.
```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/profile')
def profile():
    name = request.cookies.get('name')
    return {'name': name}
```

**FastAPI:**  
We use parameter to define the key for the cookie.  

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Cookie
app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/profile')
def profile(name = Cookie(None)):
    return {'name': name}
```

## Modular Views  
We want to decompose the views from a single app.py into separate files.
```json
- app.py
- views
  - user.py
``` 
 
**Flask:**  
In Flask, we use a concept called blueprints to manage this. We would first create a blueprint for the user view as:
```python
# views/user.py
from flask import Blueprint
user_blueprint = Blueprint('user', __name__)

@user_blueprint.route('/users')
def list_users():
    return {'users': ['a', 'b', 'c']}

```
Then, this view is registered in the main `app.py` file.
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask
from views.user import user_blueprint

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(user_blueprint)
```

**FastAPI:**  
In FastAPI, the equivalent of a blueprint is called a router. First, we create a user router as:
```python
# routers/user.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter()

@router.get('/users')
def list_users():
    return {'users': ['a', 'b', 'c']}
```

Then, we attach this router to the main app object as:  
```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routers import user

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(user.router)
```

## Data Validation  
**Flask**  
Flask doesn't provide any input data validation feature out-of-the-box. It's common practice to either write custom validation logic or use libraries such as [marshmalllow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).

**FastAPI:**  

FastAPI wraps pydantic into its framework and allow data validation by simply using a combination of pydantic schema and python type hints.  

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

@app.post('/users')
def save_user(user: User):
    return {'name': user.name,
            'age': user.age}
```

This code will perform automatic validation to ensure `name` is a string and `age` is an integer. If any other data type is sent, it auto-generates validation error with a relevant message.  

Here are some examples of pydantic schema for common use-cases.  
 
### Example 1: Key-value pairs
```json
{
  "name": "Isaac",
  "age": 60
}
```
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
```

### Example 2: Collection of things  
```json
{
  "series": ["GOT", "Dark", "Mr. Robot"]
}
```
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Metadata(BaseModel):
    series: List[str]
```

### Example 3: Nested Objects  
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "xyz",
      "age": 25
    },
    {
      "name": "abc",
      "age": 30
    }
  ],
  "group": "Group A"
}
```
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

class UserGroup(BaseModel):
    users: List[User]
    group: str
```

You can learn more about Python Type hints from [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/).

## Automatic Documentation    
**Flask**  
Flask doesn't provide any built-in feature for documentation generation. There are extensions such as [flask-swagger](https://pypi.org/project/flask-swagger/) or [flask-restful](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/swagger.html) to fill that gap but the workflow is comparatively complex.  

**FastAPI:**  
FastAPI automatically generates an interactive swagger documentation endpoint at `/docs` and a reference documentation at `/redoc`.

For example, say we had a simple view given below that echoes what the user searched for.  
```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/search')
def search(q: str):
    return {'query': q}
```

### Swagger Documentation
If you run the server and goto the endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`, you will get an auto-generated swagger documentation.  

![OpenAPI Swagger UI in FastAPI](/images/fastapi-swagger.png){: .align-center}  

You can interactively try out the API from the browser itself.

### ReDoc Documentation
In addition to swagger, if you goto the endpoint `http://127.0.0.01:8000/redoc`, you will get an auto-generated reference documentation. There is information on parameters, request format, response format and status codes.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing(CORS)  
**Flask**  
Flask doesn't provide CORS support out of the box. We need to use extension such as [flask-cors](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to configure CORS as shown below.
```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app_ = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app_)
```

**FastAPI:**  
FastAPI provides a [built-in middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/) to handle CORS. We show an example of CORS below where we are allowing any origin to access our APIs.  

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=['*'],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## Conclusion  
Thus, FastAPI is an excellent alternative to Flask for building robust APIs with best-practices baked in. You can refer to the [documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to learn more.
