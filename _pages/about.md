**About Gabe**  

An eager learner and problem solver looking for opportunities to learn and connect in healthcare, tech and education. A strong believer in hackathon communities that share, contribute and open source solutions to make a better world.

I am currently a student at [Staples High School](https://shs.westportps.org/) exploring topics across Healthcare, Natural Language Processing, Data Modeling & Computer Science.

I am also a founder of [Last Mile Now](https://lastmilenow.org/), an open source organization with the aim of solving the “last mile issue”, the most expensive and difficult part of any product deployment in technology and delivering services.
